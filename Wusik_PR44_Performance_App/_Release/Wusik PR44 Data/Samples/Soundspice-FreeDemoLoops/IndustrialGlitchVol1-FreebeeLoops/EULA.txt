The license agreement for this product is the same as it is for 99% of all loop sample sets.

These sounds are royalty free for the original purchaser. You may not share them, and you may not alter and then sell them. They are for use for personal & commercial audio production, within or as-part-of works of music. They may not be used for commercial library music.

The demo .wav files cannot be used as they are, though you can use them as a template to recreate sections that you like, or to sample and modify within or as-part-of your own music. In short, you cannot just copy & paste them and claim it as your own, that is just not legal as they are copyrighted simply by my having made them in that arrangement to begin with, this is not up to me.

If you have any questions that are not covered then please feel free to contact me through the form at http://www.sound-spice.com/contact/ and I will get back to you, usually within 48 hours.

Thanks again for your business, and I hope you find some good uses for this material in your music productions & performances. :)
