Hello,

      Thanks for your purchase of this loop sample collection.
      All the sounds heard in the main demo are included, in addition to extras and out takes from those sessions.
      The original project demo I made is also included as a template for you to get ideas from. You can in fact recreate it exactly using the loops and samples in this collection if you desire.
      In the case of un-effected reversed sounds and loops, those are not included, since anyone can do that in their own host with a simple click or two. If there is any reversed material that is included then it was included -because- it has effects added to it.
      So I guess that's it, I just wanted to add that information, and say thanks for supporting my work. I hope you get lots of use from this material, and that it provides some inspiration for your music.
