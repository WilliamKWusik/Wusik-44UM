    37: set all LEDs to Red;
    38: set all LEDs to Green;

    42: go to page 3;
    43: go to page 4;
    44: go to page 5;
    45: go to page 6;

    52~: blink fast individual LEDs white;

On MIDI Channel 3:

Here you can set RGB values for each LED individualy, using 3 notes velocity. Each note velocity will set the RGB value of the LED. Translating the 0 ~ 127 value to 0 ~ 255 of the color. Notes 36 to 51 will set the R (red) channel. Notes 52 to 67 will set the G (green) channel and above will set the B (blue) channel and update the LED. The R and G channels doesn't update the LED. This way you can set any color that you want for each LED.
